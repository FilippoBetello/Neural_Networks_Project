## 📝 Assignment
1.	Reimplement the network architecture in the [Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.13692) for Image Classification on CIFAR10.
2.  Apply this innovative architecture to Breast Cancer Detection.

## 💾 Dataset
-   [CIFAR10](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html)
-   Kaggle Dataset for Breast Histopathology Images [Link 🔗](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/paultimothymooney/breast-histopathology-images)

## 📜 Results
For CIFAR10 dataset results are very good:
